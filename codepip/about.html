                          <p>We make games that help people learn to code</p>
                          <p>Games and learning don't have to be an either/or proposition. We believe that games can be one of the most effective ways to learn. If designed well, they provide a fun but challenging path to mastery.</p>
                          <p>The popularity of our first game, Flexbox Froggy, demonstrated a hunger for these kind of games in the web dev community. We followed that up with Grid Garden.</p>
                          <p>Now we are releasing many more games that teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond, built through learner-centered design and informed by <span class="color">peer-reviewed research.</span></p>

                          <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
                          <p>The 'pip' in Codepip refers to two things. One, the dots found on gaming objects like dominoes and dice. Two, the tiny seed that grows into a towering tree.</p>

                          <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                          <p>Codepip is led by <span class="color">Thomas Park (@thomashpark)</span>, a designer and developer based in Philadelphia.
